# Ansible Collection - nixargh.ansible
## Description
A set of Ansible roles I created for my own use, which I don't mind to share with anyone.

## Roles
- `geesefs`: the role to FUSE mount S3 buckets using [GeeseFS](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs).
- `duplicity`: only installation tasks as it hasn't goes further ([Duplicity](https://duplicity.gitlab.io/docs.html) site).
- `timers`: the role to create systemd services and timers from a single dict of parameters.
- `warp`: the role to install and configure [Cloudflare WARP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/get-started/linux/) software.
